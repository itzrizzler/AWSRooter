**Disclaimer:** This guide is for informational purposes only. The authors of this README are not responsible for the script or any damage or security vulnerabilities arising from its use. Running the script can potentially modify your system settings and introduce security risks. Please exercise caution and understand the potential consequences before making system changes.

**Safer Alternative:**

Instead of directly running the script via `curl`, consider a safer approach:

1. Download the script and verify its contents before execution.
2. Make the downloaded script executable.
3. Run the script from the downloaded file.

Refer to the detailed instructions in the previous response for a safer approach.

**Additional Notes:**

* **Security:** Enabling root login carries significant security risks. Only enable it when essential and consider alternative methods for administrative tasks.
* **Swap File:** Creating a swap file can optimize performance but may not be necessary for all systems. Evaluate your RAM limitations and workload before enabling it.
* **Backups:** Always back up your system before performing critical updates or modifications.
